#### Perpetually Running Python Backend with GitHub Actions + Cloudflare Workers + GitHub Pages

This project demonstrates a modern, serverless architecture where a Python backend is run **continuously** using **GitHub Actions** ‚Äî not just for CI/CD, but as a perpetual service. It integrates with a frontend hosted on GitHub Pages and uses Cloudflare Workers as a secure gateway.

---

## Overview

### Key Components:

- **Python Backend running on GitHub Actions**  
  The backend runs as a long-lived GitHub Actions workflow, providing a continuously operating Python service without a traditional server.

- **Cloudflare Worker as Secure Proxy and Health Monitor**  
  Acts as a secure ‚Äúdoorman‚Äù that validates requests and proxies backend data to the frontend, enabling a pure HTML frontend without exposing sensitive API keys. Additionally, it runs a **cron job every 1 minute** that uses the GitHub API and a limited-permission personal access token to check if the GitHub Action backend is running. If the backend is down, the Worker automatically triggers a restart of the GitHub Action to ensure continuous uptime.

- **Firestore Database**  
  Used to store and update the current backend URL dynamically, helping the system work around GitHub Actions‚Äô 6-hour runtime limit.

- **Frontend hosted on GitHub Pages**  
  A static website that interacts with the backend via Cloudflare Worker.

---

## How It Works

### 1. GitHub Actions as a Perpetual Python Backend

- The Python backend runs inside a GitHub Actions workflow.
- Since GitHub Actions have a **6-hour maximum runtime**, the backend cannot run indefinitely.
- To handle this, the backend updates the Firestore database with its current active public URL before the workflow stops.
- This way, other system components always know where to find the **currently active backend instance**.

### 2. Firestore: Managing Backend URL State

- Firestore acts as a dynamic registry that stores the URL of the active Python backend.
- When the GitHub Actions backend instance starts, it writes its accessible URL to Firestore.
- Other parts of the system (Cloudflare Worker, frontend) query Firestore to find the current backend URL to use.
- This ensures seamless switching between backend instances every 6 hours.

### 3. Cloudflare Worker: Secure Proxy, API Key Protection, and Backend Health Monitoring

- The frontend is a **pure static HTML site** hosted on **GitHub Pages**.
- Since Firestore requires authentication via API keys, exposing these keys directly in frontend code would be insecure.
- The Cloudflare Worker acts as a **secure proxy** that:
  - Validates incoming requests to allow only trusted origins (e.g., your GitHub Pages site).
  - Requests the current backend URL from Firestore.
  - Proxies backend data to the frontend without exposing Firestore API keys.
- **Health Monitoring:**  
  The Worker uses a **cron trigger every 1 minute** to query the GitHub API using a personal access token with limited permissions. This token only allows checking the status of the GitHub Actions workflow. If the workflow is detected as stopped or failed, the Worker automatically triggers the workflow to restart the Python backend.
- This architecture allows a secure, keyless frontend experience with automated backend uptime management.

### 4. Frontend on GitHub Pages

- The static frontend lets users interact with the system by requesting URLs via the Cloudflare Worker.
- The Worker returns the backend data fetched through Firestore, enabling dynamic functionality without server code on the frontend.

## Benefits

- **Overcomes GitHub Actions runtime limits:** Uses Firestore to keep backend URL state across backend restarts every 6 hours.
- **Automated backend uptime monitoring:** Cloudflare Worker cron job checks backend status every minute via GitHub API and restarts workflow if needed.
- **Secure frontend without API keys:** Cloudflare Worker hides Firestore API keys and validates requests.
- **No traditional servers needed:** Backend runs on free GitHub Actions CI infrastructure.
- **Fully automated:** Deployment and backend execution are managed via GitHub Actions workflows and Cloudflare Worker cron jobs.

## Usage

1. **Set up Firestore database**  
   Create Firestore collections to store the active backend URL and any necessary data.

2. **Deploy Python backend with GitHub Actions**  
   Configure a workflow that runs the backend, updates Firestore with the active URL, and renews itself as needed.

3. **Deploy Cloudflare Worker**  
   Write and deploy a Worker script to securely proxy requests between frontend and backend, and set up a cron trigger that every 1 minute checks backend status using GitHub API with a personal access token and restarts the workflow if necessary.

4. **Host frontend on GitHub Pages**  
   Publish the static site that interacts with the Cloudflare Worker.


## Notes

- GitHub Actions runtime limit of 6 hours requires backend URL rotation.
- Firestore stores and updates backend URLs dynamically.
- Cloudflare Worker protects Firestore API keys from exposure in frontend code.
- Cloudflare Worker uses a personal access token with limited permissions to monitor and restart GitHub Actions workflows automatically.
- Monitor GitHub Actions usage to avoid hitting limits.
